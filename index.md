## Arriving by train

The meeting location is a **10 min walk** away from the main train station. In case you want to take the 
bus, hop onto line 6 and get off at Jakob-Haringer Str. 2 (you should already see the building).

## Arriving by car

In case you plan to travel by car, please let me (Roland Kwitt) know in advance. We do have a parking lot, but it's mandatory to keep track of who uses it, and we will have to coordinate that it's open when you arrive.
